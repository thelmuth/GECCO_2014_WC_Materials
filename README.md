#### Source code
An archive of the source code for Clojush, the Clojure version of Push used to run our experiments, can be found [here](https://github.com/thelmuth/Clojush/releases/tag/wcPaper). The most recent version of Clojush can be found in its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lspector/Clojush).

#### Evolved solutions to wc problem
The 11 solution programs we evolved in our experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/thelmuth/GECCO_2014_WC_Materials/blob/master/simplified_successes.push). Note that these programs have been automatically simplified to remove instructions that have no effect on the outputs of their programs.
