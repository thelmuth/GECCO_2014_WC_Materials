Spector. Word Count as a Traditional Programming Benchmark Problem for Genetic Programming. In _GECCO '14: Proceedings of the 16th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation_. July 2014. ACM.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Abstract\r\n(Will be added soon)\r\n\r\n#### Full paper\r\n(Will be added soon)\r\n\r\n## Supplementary materials\r\n\r\n#### Source code\r\nAn archive of the source code for Clojush, the Clojure version of Push used to run our experiments, can be found [here](https://github.com/thelmuth/Clojush/releases/tag/wcPaper). The most recent version of Clojush can be found in its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lspector/Clojush).\r\n\r\n#### Evolved solutions to wc problem\r\nThe 11 solution programs we evolved in our experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/thelmuth/GECCO_2014_WC_Materials/blob/master/simplified_successes.push). Note that these programs have been automatically simplified to remove instructions that have no effect on the outputs of their programs.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
